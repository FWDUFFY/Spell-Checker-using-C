# Spell-Checker-using-C
This project, part of the CS50 course, implements a dictionary using a hash table in C. It includes functionalities to load words from a file, hash them for storage, check word existence, and unload the dictionary from memory. The hash table has 100,000 buckets, each handling collisions with linked lists. Key functions include load for reading and inserting words into the hash table, hash for generating hash values, size for returning the number of words, check for verifying word presence, and unload for freeing memory. This project exemplifies efficient dictionary management using a combination of hash tables and linked lists.
